# monthly

##### [monthly](month-ly.herokuapp.com) is a website that allows users to log in through Spotify and automatically generate playlists based on their current music library

a playlist generated by the monthly website will consist of songs that were saved in each individual month/season - regardless of the year.

(this is similar to certain spotify custom playlists such as "summer rewind" or "repeat rewind" - but monthly includes all of the songs that you listened to)

---

### users can make the following specifications to produce their aggregated playlists:
* include/exclude certain playlists from aggregations
* choose between 12, 4, and 1 playlist based on months, seasons, and a singular specified month respectively
* toggle whether or not "liked tracks" are included in the aggregation
   * some people use this feature as a means of saving music - rather than just adding songs to playlists

monthly is a flask app hosted on heroku and uses the spotify api wrapper  ['spotipy'](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy) to make requests to spotify
